                    Bangladesh, to the east of India on the Bay of Bengal, is a South Asian country marked by lush greenery
                    and many waterways. Its Padma (Ganges), Meghna and Jamuna rivers create fertile plains, and travel by
                    boat is common. On the southern coast, the Sundarbans, an enormous mangrove forest shared with Eastern
                    India, is home to the royal Bengal tiger.

                    The etymology of Bangladesh ("Bengali Country") can be traced to the early 20th century, when Bengali
                patriotic songs, such as Namo Namo Namo Bangladesh Momo by Kazi Nazrul Islam and Aaji Bangladesher
                Hridoy by Rabindranath Tagore, used the term.[30] The term Bangladesh was often written as two words,
                Bangla Desh, in the past. Starting in the 1950s, Bengali nationalists used the term in political rallies
                in East Pakistan. The term Bangla is a major name for both the Bengal region and the Bengali language.
                The origins of the term Bangla are unclear, with theories pointing to a Bronze Age proto-Dravidian
                tribe,[31] the Austric word "Bonga" (Sun god), and the Iron Age Vanga Kingdom.[citation needed] The
                earliest known usage of the term is the Nesari plate in 805 AD. The term Vangaladesa is found in
                11th-century South Indian records.[32][33] The term gained official status during the Sultanate of
                Bengal in the 14th century.[34][35] Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah proclaimed himself as the first "Shah of
                Bangala" in 1342.[34] The word BangƒÅl
